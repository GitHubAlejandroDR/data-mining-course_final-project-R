# Pathology Complete Response Predictors Design on Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer Integrating Gene Expression Data

## Description 

This project focused on the design of pathological complete response prediction models (PCR) in neoadjuvant breast cancer. The dataset used consists of clinicopathological and gene expression data. 

The workflow is defined by: 

1) Descriptive analysis and statistical inference of clinical-pathologic features in relation to response (CRP)
2) Missing value imputation
3) Class imbalance techniques
4) Feature selection
5) 5x2 cross-validation
6) Model evaluation
7) Comparison of model results
